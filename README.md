# DissProject
These are my Python scripts for my dissertation project on semantic drift in the biblical corpus.

The scripts used for each chapter are in the appropriate sub-directory.  The Data_Production folder contains the scripts needed to produce the data necessary for the whole dissertation (i.e., the sem_extract_pipeline.py file).
