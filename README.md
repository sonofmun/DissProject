# DissProject
These are my Python scripts for my dissertation project on semantic drift in the biblical corpus.

The scripts used for each chapter are in the appropriate sub-directory.  The Data_Production folder contains the scripts needed to produce the data necessary for the whole dissertation (i.e., the sem_extract_pipeline.py file).

All programs were written in Python 3. In order to use the scripts, I suggest that you create a virtual environment (e.g., http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/). In any case, you can install all prerequisites to run these files by navigating to the base directory of this repository in a terminal and typing:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
Please see the documentation for the individual Python packages for prerequisites for these packages.
