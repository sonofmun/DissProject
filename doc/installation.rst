Installation
============

Running the code included in this repository requires Python 3.5 or newer. Instructions for installing Python can be found in the `Python Documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html>`_. I would also suggest installing everything in a new virtual environment (`guide <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`_).

Once you have Python set up (and your virtual environment active, if you are using one), clone the `repository from Github <https://github.com/sonofmun/DissProject>`_, change directories into the directory into which you cloned, and type::

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ pip install -r requirements2.txt
    
This should start the installation for all of the required Python packages. If any errors occur during the installation, see the documentation for that package for possible solutions.  Once both of these commands have completed successfully, you are ready to get started.
