Introduction - Tools for the Automatic Extraction of Semantic Information
=========================================================================

The code here was produced during Matt Munson's dissertation process in the Theologische Fakult√§t at the University of Leipzig in Germany. It was produced to work with Greek texts formatted in a pseudo-TEI-XML style. While it is expected to be applicable to any other language or any other textual format, perhaps with a few minor modifications, there is no guarantee that this is the case and, thus, any user should do extensive testing if they wish to so apply it.

This documentation is broken down just as the dissertation itself was broken down: into chapters. Each chapter has its own section documenting the code that was used in that chapter. The documentation for the individual chapters are:
